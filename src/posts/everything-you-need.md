This post exists for one purpose: **to prove that everything you need is already here**.  
Every common Markdown element is rendered correctly, styled intentionally, and feels consistent across devices.

## Headings

Markdown supports six levels of headings:

# Heading Level 1
## Heading Level 2
### Heading Level 3
#### Heading Level 4
##### Heading Level 5
###### Heading Level 6

Headings should scale well, respect hierarchy, and remain readable on all screen sizes.

## Paragraphs & Text Styling

Markdown paragraphs are simple, but powerful.

You can emphasize text using **bold**, *italic*, or ***both***.  
You can also use ~~strikethrough~~ when needed.

Inline code looks like this: `npm run build`

## Links

You can link to external resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs)
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com)

## Lists

### Unordered List

- Clean
- Predictable
- Easy to scan
  - Nested item
  - Another nested item

### Ordered List

1. Write content
2. Render Markdown
3. Style consistently
4. Ship with confidence

## Blockquotes

> Good design is as little design as possible.  
> — *Dieter Rams*

Blockquotes should stand out without being distracting.

## Code Blocks

### Shell Command

```txt
npm install
npm run dev
```

### Java

```java
void main() {
    IO.println("Everything you need.");
}
```

this is java language

### Javascript

```javascript
export function greet(name) {
  return `Hello, ${name}`;
}
```

Each language should be highlighted correctly and remain readable.
