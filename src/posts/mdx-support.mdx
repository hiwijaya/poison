Poison comes with built-in [MDX support](https://mdxjs.com/), giving you the freedom to write content using Markdown while seamlessly embedding React components when needed. This makes it perfect for technical blogs, documentation, and developer-focused writing where code and content live side by side.

Unlike plain Markdown, MDX allows you to go beyond static text. You can import and use components directly inside your posts—making your content more expressive, interactive, and maintainable.

## Why MDX?

MDX unlocks a powerful writing workflow:

- Write clean, readable Markdown  
- Embed React components anywhere in your content  
- Reuse UI elements like alerts, callouts, or demos  
- Keep content and presentation tightly integrated  

With MDX, your blog posts are no longer limited to text—they become part of your application.

## Example: Using a React Component

Below is a simple example of using a React component inside an MDX post:

<div className="mb-4">
    <RedirectButton href="https://github.com/hiwijaya/poison">GET POISON</RedirectButton>
</div>

This approach keeps your content flexible while maintaining a consistent design system across the site.

## Built for Developers

MDX support in Poison is designed with developers in mind. It works seamlessly with Next.js, supports static generation, and integrates cleanly with modern tooling. Whether you're writing tutorials, release notes, or long-form articles, MDX lets you focus on clarity without sacrificing power.
